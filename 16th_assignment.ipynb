    "Q2. In Flask, the request object is used to access and interact with incoming HTTP requests made to the Flask application. It provides a convenient way to retrieve data sent by the client, such as form data, URL parameters, and headers. The request object is an instance of the Request class in the Werkzeug library, which Flask builds upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for the request object in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Form Data:\n",
    "When a client submits an HTML form, the form data is sent as part of the HTTP request. The request object allows you to access this form data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",

    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "    password = request.form.get('password')\n",
    "    # Process form data\n",
    "    return f'Username: {username}, Password: {password}'\n",
    "Handling URL Parameters:\n",
    "The request object provides access to URL parameters (query string parameters) in a GET request. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request\n",

    "    # Retrieve user data based on the user_id\n",
    "    return f'Retrieving user with ID: {user_id}'\n",
    "Accessing JSON Data:\n",
    "When the client sends data in JSON format in the request body (common in API development), the request object allows you to access that data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "@app.route('/api/data', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def process_json_data():\n",
    "    json_data = request.json\n",
    "    # Process JSON data\n",
    "    return jsonify({'message': 'Data processed successfully'})\n",
    "Handling File Uploads:\n",
    "If your application supports file uploads, the request object can be used to access files sent in the request. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request\n",

    "    uploaded_file = request.files['file']\n",
    "    # Process the uploaded file\n",
    "    return f'File uploaded: {uploaded_file.filename}'\n",

    "Q3. In Flask, the redirect() function is used to perform an HTTP redirect. It is part of the Flask framework and allows you to redirect the client's browser to a different URL. This is useful in web applications for various scenarios, such as after form submissions, successful login/logout, or when you want to direct users to a different part of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might use redirect() in a Flask application:\n",

    "# Run the application if the script is executed\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The /submit_form route handles a form submission, processes the form data, and then uses redirect(url_for('success_page')) to redirect the user to the /success page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The /success route displays a success message, and the user is redirected to this page after a successful form submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The redirect() function helps in keeping the flow of your web application organized and user-friendly. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to guide the user to a different page based on the outcome of an operation. Instead of rendering a new page directly, you use redirect() to send the user's browser to the specified URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that after a redirect, the client's browser makes a new request to the specified URL. The url_for() function is often used in conjunction with redirect() to generate URLs dynamically based on the names of Flask routes, which makes your code more maintainable, especially if you decide to change URL patterns later."

    "Q4. In Flask, templates are used to separate the HTML structure from the Python code in your application.
